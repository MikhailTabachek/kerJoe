**About this website**


As a guest, you can view the list of jokes. If you want to add your joke you need to register and to be logged in. Once you logged in, you can edit or delete only your jokes. To read a joke, you need to click on "Read a Joke". On each joke page, you can find a button, if you click on it, you will hear a Joker's laugh.

**How I built this website**

My name is Mikhail. This is my 4th project for my SEI course at General Assembly. I dedicated this project to our instructor Joe Malatesta. He always makes jokes and trying to make his students smile. As always I used [Trello](https://trello.com/) to organize and plan the scope of work. [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/) was my go to website for wireframes.

To build this website I've used:

What I've learned after I built this website:

* Flask is an interesting framework to work with
* Python synthax is way more simpler than JS

My future plans for this project:

* Add option for uploading pictures

This website was built in April 2022.
